Welcome! 

This is a small project that I am working on. I am trying to accomplish some of the following goals:
1. Understand Gauge Theory from a mathematical point of view
2. Visualize gauge invariance, gauge transformations, and gauge fields
3. Connect this understanding to General Relativity and it's relationship to the Lorentz Group
4. Understand the implementation of C++ code into python
5. Work with Mathematical Animations and 3D visualization in python


Note that this project uses the python package manager uv. 
Example code:

Virtual Env: source .venv/bin/activate.fish
Install package: uv pip install ___
Run script: uv run ___

More can be found on the website. Primarily we will be working with Matplotlib and Manim in python.
